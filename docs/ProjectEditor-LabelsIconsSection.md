This is where you'll define long and short labels, as well as icons, for your tables and fields.

* <b>Short and long labels:</b> Long and short labels are used according to the available space in the template (to optimize space and avoid overcrowding the tab bar).
* <b>Icons:</b> 4D for iOS provides a large library of embedded icons to meet your needs. These include icons for commerce, finance, education, government, health, industry, real estate, services, etc.

* To keep everything consistent, <b>default icons</b> are generated for blank fields if at least one icon has been defined for a field. 

* You can also leave your the icon area empty if you don’t want to display icons in your application.
