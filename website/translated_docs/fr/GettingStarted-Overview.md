## What is 4D for iOS?

4D for iOS is an integrated 4D component that allows you to configure, design, build, and deploy a native iOS app based on your 4D database.

## Fully integrated in 4D

With 4D for iOS, you can easily create a new mobile project directly from 4D, without needing any prior expertise building native iOS apps.

## Create native apps

* 4D handles the complexity and generates - in a totally transparent way - an Xcode project in pure Swift with an optimized UI/UX.
* One of the strengths of 4D for iOS is that you have the opportunity to create an unlimited number of apps from different subsets of your database ... according to your needs and goals.

## Supports offline mode

* All of your data is embedded in your app and available without needing an internet connection.

## Open solution

* 4D for iOS generates a real Xcode project. You can reopen it with Xcode and continue to work on it.
* All tables and forms are embedded into the generated app and are editable.
