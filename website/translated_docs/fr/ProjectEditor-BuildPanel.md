When you're satisfied that your app is ready, you can launch it in the Simulator to test it.

Let’s take a closer look at the Build tab options:

* **Build and Run:** Launches the app in the Simulator.

* **iPhone X:** The default Simulator. Clicking here will reveal a dropdown list with all available simulators.

* **Project:** Reveals a dropdown list where you can **open the project folder** or **product folder**, or **open the product with Xcode**.

* **Install:** Installs the application on a connected device.

Select a Simulator on which to build and test your app, and press the **Build and Run** button.
