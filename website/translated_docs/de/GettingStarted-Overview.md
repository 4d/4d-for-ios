## What is 4D for iOS?

4D for iOS is an integrated 4D component that allows you to configure, design, build, and deploy a native iOS app based on your 4D database.

## Fully integrated in 4D

With 4D for iOS, you can easily create a new mobile project directly from 4D, without any prior expertise building native iOS apps.

## Create native apps
* 4D generates - in a totally transparent way - an Xcode project in pure Swift with an optimized UI/UX.
* One of the strengths of 4D for iOS is the ability to create an unlimited number of apps from different subsets of your database, based on your needs and your goals.

## Supports offline mode
* All the data is embedded in your app and available without an internet connection.

## Open solution
* 4D for iOS generates a real Xcode project. You can reopen it with Xcode and continue working on it.
* All tables and forms are embedded into the generated app and are editable.
